# Bonus Challenge for HRS139

## Build Tic Tac Toe
This challenge aims to help your native ability to use Javascript, HTML, and CSS. You are encouraged to use Javascript to build a page using the native methods. 

For example [Document.createElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement) can make HTML elements. 

[Event.Target.addEventListener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener) can add events. 

Using these and CSS as well as the other native Javascript methods for handling events build tic tac toe. 

Also try to get familiar with the script type modules and the ES6 import export syntax described [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules).

If stuck use the hints file Readme. 

Once complete try to add more features like: 
- Keep track of the winner from the last round and allow the winner (X or O) to make the first move on the next round of gameplay.
- Keep a tally of the number of times X vs. O won a game. Refreshing the page (CMD+R) should reset the tally.
- Let each player (X vs. O) enter their name. Display this name next to the player's symbol (X vs. O).
- Make the board respond to different screen sizes
